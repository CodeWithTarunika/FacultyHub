# Faculty Hub - Faculty Directory Project

## Overview
Faculty Hub is a web application designed to serve as a centralized faculty directory for an institution. Built using Python's Flask framework, it provides an accessible platform for both outsiders and faculty members. Outsiders can view staff details, while authenticated staff members have the privilege to log in, update their profiles, and new staff members can register.

## Features

- Authentication System: Staff members have personalized logins to access and update their profiles, enhancing privacy and security.
